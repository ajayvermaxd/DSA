Array Initialization: Create an empty list in Python and add elements to it to create an array of integers. Demonstrate how to append, insert, and remove elements from the array.

Array Operations: Write a Python function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the sum of all the elements in the array. Optimize the function for large arrays.

Linked List Creation: Implement a basic singly linked list class in Python. Include methods for appending nodes, inserting nodes at specific positions, and printing the linked list.

Linked List Operations: Write a Python function to reverse a singly linked list in-place. Provide both iterative and recursive solutions.

Array Searching:Given an array of integers and a target value, write a Python function to find the index of the target value in the array using binary search. Ensure that the array is sorted before applying binary search.
Linked List Cycle Detection:

Create a Python function to detect if a given linked list contains a cycle. Implement Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm to solve this problem efficiently.
